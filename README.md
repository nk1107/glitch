- TAILWIND CSS 🎨 was chosen as the CSS framework due to its efficiency in designing responsive and user-friendly interfaces. The utility-first framework offers easy customization and eliminates the need to write additional CSS, thereby simplifying the development process.

- NODE.JS 🖥️ was selected for its ability to handle multiple requests concurrently, scalability and performance. As a runtime environment, it allows for the development of performant server-side applications using JavaScript.

- The MYSQL 🗄️ database management system was chosen due to its robust data management capabilities, scalability, and reliability in handling complex data relationships.

- PRISMA ORM 🛡️ was selected as the database toolkit due to its ease of use and ability to manage the database schema and data access layer. It provides seamless integration with Node.js and other web frameworks, which enables efficient management of data.

- AXIOS API 🚀 is a JavaScript library used to simplify the process of making HTTP requests from the browser. It was chosen due to its simplicity, efficiency in handling complex data structures, and the ability to provide efficient error handling.
